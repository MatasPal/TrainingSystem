Training system project for KTU OPP module

This system will allow coaches to create workouts and keep track of the required inventory. Athletes can easily register for training sessions, pay for them and receive reminders (incoming notifications) about the sessions they have registered for. Trainers can conduct training sessions not only in sports clubs, but also outdoors, in parks, playgrounds, stadiums... With the help of registration, they can accurately predict the amount of equipment needed for a given training session based on the number of registered athletes. Athletes can register, make payments, see advice on clothing and the exact location of the training session. After the training session, the athlete can leave feedback about the coach and the training session

The main objective of the system is to facilitate the process of recording and tracking workouts.
